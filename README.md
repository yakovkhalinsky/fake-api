#### Super Simple Fake API Server

The idea is to just run a node.js process that just reflects data back in the response.

#### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/yakovkhalinsky/fake-api.git
```

#### Running

Running on standard port `1337`
```
node index.js
```

Running on custom port
```
PORT=1234 node index.js
```
